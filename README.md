## Abstract

This RFC proposes the development and implementation of the GenAiGraphics application aimed at revolutionizing the way users interact with complex technology set ups. By integrapting 3D graphics rendering and AI-driven interactions, GenAiGraphics will provide users with an intuitive, interactive  and visual aid that simplifies the set up process, reduces user errors, and enhances overall user experience.

## Context and Business Goals

In today's fast-paced technological landscape, users are often faced with complex technology set ups that require a high level of technical knowledge and expertise to configure. This can be a daunting task for many users, leading to frustration, errors, and suboptimal user experience. GenAiGraphics aims to address this challenge by providing users with an intuitive, interactive, and visual aid that simplifies the set up process and enhances overall user experience.

The key business goals of GenAiGraphics are as follows:

1. Reducing Errors and Support Costs
2. Enhancing User Experience and Satisfaction
3. Streamlining the Set Up Process for novices and expert users 
4. Providing a Competitive Edge in the Market

## Stakeholders

- Product Team : Ensures the solution aligns with the product vision and goals
- Development Team : Responsible for the implementation and deployment of the solution
- Users : The end users who will interact with the GenAiGraphics application

## Technical Requirements

To accurately capture the 3D graphics we conducted extensive user research, gathered feedback from customer support, and reviewed existing literature on 3D graphics rendering and AI integration. 

The Key technical requirements for GenAiGraphics are as follows:
1. 3D Graphics Rendering : Utiliazation of WebGL and Three.js to render high-quality interactive 3D graphics
2. AI Chat Functionality : Integration with Azure ML Prompt Flow for intelligent, responsive chat interactions.
3. User-Friendly Interface : Development using the Astro framework and Tailwind CSS for a seamless and visually appealing user experience.
4. Scalability and Performance : Ensuring the application can handle a large number of users and complex models efficiently.
5. Robust backend : An Express server to manage API reuqests and data storage.


## Proposed Solution
1. Phase 1: Research and Planning
- Conduct user research to identify user needs and gather feedback from stakeholders
- Define the scope, requirements, and timeline for the project
2. Phase 2: Development
- Build the front-end interface using the Astro framework and Tailwind CSS
- Develop the core WebGL class using Three.js 
- Integrate the Azure ML Prompt Flow API for AI chat functionality 
- Set up the Express server for backend support
3. Phase 3: Testing and Iteration
- Conduct extensive testing to ensure the application is bug-free and user-friendly
- Gather feedback from beta users and iterate on the design
4. Phase 4: Deployment
- Deploy the application to a Azure cloud server
- Monitor performance and user feedback to make further improvements

## Key Features

1. Visual Technology Set Up Assistance helps users navigate technology setups with interactive 3D models that demonstrate specific actions.
2. WebGL Integration: Manages rendering, scenes, camera control, resizing events, and frame animations.
3. AI Chat Functionality: Provides intelligent responses, recommendations for the users next messages based on user queries.
4. Server-Side Operations: Manages API requests, data storage, and user authentication.


## Implementation Plan

1. Conduct user research and gather feedback from stakeholders
2. Define the scope, requirements, and timeline for the project
3. Develop the front-end interface using the Astro framework and Tailwind CSS
4. Build the core WebGL class using Three.js
5. Integrate the Azure ML Prompt Flow API for AI chat functionality
6. Set up the Express server for backend support
7. Conduct extensive testing and gather feedback from beta users
8. Deploy the application to an Azure cloud server
9. Monitor performance and user feedback to make further improvements

## Measuring Success

The success of the GenAiGraphics application will be measured based on the following key metrics:

1. User Engagement: The number of users interacting with the application and the average session duration.
2. Error Reduction: Reduction in the number of support tickets related to technology set up issues.
3. Engagement: User engagement metrics such as time spent on the application and interaction rates.
4. Performance: System performance metrics such as response time and scalability.

## Challenges and Trade-offs

### Challenges

- Complex of 3D Models: Ensuring the 3D models are both realistic and performant and can be challenging.
- AI Integration: Providing accurate and helpful AI responses requires robust training and fine-tuning of the models.

### Trade-offs
- Performance vs Realism: Balancing performance and realism of the 3D models with the need for a responsive and performant application.
- Development Time vs Features: Prioritizing key features to ensure a timely launch while planning for future enhancements.
