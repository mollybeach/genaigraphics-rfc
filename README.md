## Abstract

This RFC proposes the development and implementation of the GenAiGraphics application aimed at revolutionizing the way users interact with complex technology set ups. By integrapting 3D graphics rendering and AI-driven interactions, GenAiGraphics will provide users with an intuitive, interactive  and visual aid that simplifies the set up process, reduces user errors, and enhances overall user experience.

## Context and Business Goals

In today's fast-paced technological landscape, users are often faced with complex technology set ups that require a high level of technical knowledge and expertise to configure. This can be a daunting task for many users, leading to frustration, errors, and suboptimal user experience. GenAiGraphics aims to address this challenge by providing users with an intuitive, interactive, and visual aid that simplifies the set up process and enhances overall user experience.

The key business goals of GenAiGraphics are as follows:

1. Reducing Errors and Support Costs
2. Enhancing User Experience and Satisfaction
3. Streamlining the Set Up Process for novices and expert users 
4. Providing a Competitive Edge in the Market

## Stakeholders

- Product Team : Ensures the solution aligns with the product vision and goals
- Development Team : Responsible for the implementation and deployment of the solution
- Users : The end users who will interact with the GenAiGraphics application

## Technical Requirements

To accurately capture the 3D graphics we conducted extensive user research, gathered feedback from customer support, and reviewed existing literature on 3D graphics rendering and AI integration. 

The Key technical requirements for GenAiGraphics are as follows:
1. 3D Graphics Rendering : Utiliazation of WebGL and Three.js to render high-quality interactive 3D graphics
2. AI Chat Functionality : Integration with Azure ML Prompt Flow for intelligent, responsive chat interactions.
3. User-Friendly Interface : Development using the Astro framework and Tailwind CSS for a seamless and visually appealing user experience.
4. Scalability and Performance : Ensuring the application can handle a large number of users and complex models efficiently.
5. Robust backend : An Express server to manage API reuqests and data storage.
